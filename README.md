## 🚀 **About**  
I ship working products. I thrive in small teams that punch above their weight class. I’m a pragmatic developer who prioritizes business outcomes over tech hype. Guided by [Occam’s Razor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) applied in building software: choose the simplest path that delivers business value and keeps the future maintainable.

I’ve done this inside the companies I own: 

* Adematic (2024→ Present) Shifted our focus to AI. Our AI playbook is minimalist: (1) AI Prompts based on Peer-reviewed papers for reliability, (2) RAG for verifiable context, (3) Fine-tuning only when the ROI adds up. Outcome: smaller surface area, faster automation, easier maintenance. The goal is still the same, ship software that earns its keep.

</p>

* Codetoki (2012–2015) spun out of Bootyard, got funded in Singapore, and picked up awards from Microsoft, ADB, and WEF/Young Global Leaders.

</p>

* Bootyard (2011–2024) focused on Ruby on Rails and web apps. Grew a 30+ person team, shipped multi-tenant SaaS, and helped clients raise millions. Led HURR’s platform/iOS and white-label rollouts (Selfridges, Matches, John Lewis, Rixo), and contributed to a US startup that exited in 2022 (LeagueSide → TeamSnap).


Day to day, I engineer end-to-end AI systems spanning document & OCR pipelines, LLM + RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) models, and inference / deployment infrastructure, paired with React UIs for interaction. My stack now centers on Python / FastAPI for backend APIs, PostgreSQL for persistence, and containerized infrastructure (Docker + deployment / orchestration pipelines) for scalable delivery.

</p>

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence (final year) at the University of Waikato to sharpen the practical AI I put into products. Therefore, I accept only a limited number of engagements per quarter to stay focused. If you believe in simple plans, steady delivery, and software that earns its keep, we’re already on the same side!

### :octocat: **Study Space Occupancy Detector (SSOD)**  

The Study Space Occupancy Detector (SSOD) is an IoT-based system developed to monitor and optimize the utilization of study spaces in university settings. Using sensors like Raspberry Pi, Infrared Tracking Sensors, and thermistors, the system tracks real-time room occupancy, temperature, and environmental conditions. This data is sent to a central Django-based application for analysis and visualization, enabling universities to manage study space availability efficiently and enhance the overall student experience. SSOD aims to ensure that students have access to productive and comfortable study environments, while also supporting energy-efficient campus operations.
